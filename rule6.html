        <p>Not everyone has the same amount of experience 
            working in the virtual world. And not everyone 
            knows the rules of netiquette. At some point, 
            you will see a stupid question, read an 
            unnecessarily long response, or encounter misspelled 
            words. 
            <br>
            When this happens, practice kindness and forgiveness 
            as you would hope someone would do if you had committed the 
            same offense. If it's a minor "offense," you might want to 
            let it slide. If you feel compelled to respond to a mistake, 
            do so in a private email rather than a public forum.
