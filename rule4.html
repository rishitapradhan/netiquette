        <p>One of the best things about the virtual world is the lack 
            of judgment associated with your physical appearance, sound 
            of your voice, or the clothes you wear (unless you post a 
            video of yourself singing Karaoke in a clown outfit.) You will, 
            however, be judged by the quality of your writing, so keep the 
            following tips in mind:
            <br>
            Always check for spelling and grammar errors
            <br>
            Know what you're talking about and state it clearly
            <br>
            Be pleasant and polite
            
        </p><br>
