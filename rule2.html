        <p>Avoid sending inappropriate pictures or even unedited 
            home videos. If you would have a problem with your 
            boss, your parents, or your kids seeing it now, or 
            at any point in the future, don't post it online.
            The same goes for phone conversations in public 
            places. Just because you can't see the person 
            you are talking to doesn't mean everyone around you 
            can't see and hear you.</p><br>
