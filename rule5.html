        <p>That cure for cancer might sound pretty impressive, 
            but it will just cause upset if it is a hoax. And 
            urban myths add to the noise of the internet and 
            waste people's time. If you aren't sure of the facts, 
            email it to someone who does know or can find out. Or 
            do a search on Google or snopes.com.
            <br>
            Don't forget that many viruses are circulated via chain 
            letters and invitations to send some seemingly pertinent 
            piece of information to ten of your friends, or everyone 
            in your address book. So don't be naive. Forwarding that 
            message will not bring you good luck, just bad karma.
