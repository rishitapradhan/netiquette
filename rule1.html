        <p>Name-calling, cursing, expressing deliberately offensive opinionsâ€”
            if you wouldn't do it to the face of anyone who might conceivably 
            see what you write, don't write it. This goes for any social media 
            site, forum, chat room, or email message, even if you think it can't 
            be traced back to you. It can.
            And it's not just what you say, but how you say it. Either take the 
            trouble to use the shift key for capital letters, or write in all lower 
            case, but don't use caps lock. Text in all caps is generally perceived 
            as yelling. Please don't forget to say please and thank you as 
            appropriate.
