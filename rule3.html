        <p>Don't forward information sent to you without 
            checking with the original sender first. Use 
            BCC (blind carbon copy) rather than CC (carbon copy) 
            if you are sending something out to more than one person. 
            You might think that we are all friends online, but your 
            friends may not want their names and or email addresses 
            publicized to people they do not even know.<br>
            The same goes for uploading photos or videos that include 
            other people to public space or sending them out to your own 
            contacts. And remember, if you tag people on Facebook, 
            others can access pictures of those people, unless they 
            have adjusted their privacy settings.<br>
            Finally, don't sign up for newsletters and other communications 
            using someone else's email address.
